<h2>Projects: Here's a Game!</h2>
<p>If you are bored, there's this game I've developed.. the one you are looking at in the background of this page. <a href="https://morning-shelf-53406.herokuapp.com" target="_blank">Check that out</a>. </p>
<p>Basically, it's an HTML5 game, created with the help of <a href="http://www.createjs.com" target="_blank">CreateJS</a>, backed by a backend written in <a href="https://tour.golang.org/welcome/1" target="_blank">golang</a>. Yes, multiple players can play simultaneously. Have fun!</p>
