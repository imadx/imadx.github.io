<p>Creating real-time multiplayer experiences presents unique challenges, especially when precise synchronization and
smooth animations are crucial. In this article, I'll delve into the development of a system for displaying live
cursors (mouse pointers) of multiple players on a shared board. Having previously experimented with similar concepts in
less demanding environments, I faced the task of building a robust and accurate solution for a real-world application.
This project, while concise, offered valuable insights into tackling latency, event management, and animation smoothing.</p>
<h3>The Challenge: Real-time Cursor Synchronization</h3>
<p>My previous attempts at implementing real-time cursor sharing were primarily proof-of-concept projects with relaxed
requirements. This new project demanded a production-ready solution, requiring careful consideration of network latency,
event handling, and rendering. The core challenge was ensuring a smooth and accurate representation of each player's
cursor movements across all clients, even under varying network conditions.</p>
<h3>Addressing Latency</h3>
<p>Network latency is an inherent issue in real-time applications. If events (cursor position updates) are sent
infrequently, the resulting cursor movement appears jerky and discontinuous, especially with latencies exceeding 50ms.
Simply updating the cursor position based on each received event is insufficient. In prior projects, I used basic
tweening (linear interpolation) between event positions to smooth the motion. However, this approach has a critical
flaw: if intermediate events are lost due to network issues, the cursor's path becomes inaccurate.</p>
<p>To address this, I implemented a more robust event management system. This involved:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Event Matching and Prioritization:</strong> Ensuring that the most up-to-date events are sent to and processed by the
server and subsequently broadcast to other clients. This minimized the impact of out-of-order or duplicate events.</li>
<li><strong>Batching Events:</strong> Grouping multiple cursor position updates into batches before sending them to the server. This
reduces network overhead and improves efficiency, especially under high event frequency.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Replaying Cursor Movements with Interpolation</h3>
<p>Batching events introduces a new challenge: how to accurately render the cursor's path on receiving clients. The
solution was to implement a replay mechanism that reconstructs the cursor's movement based on the received batch of
events. This involved:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Position History:</strong> Maintaining a history of cursor positions for each player.</li>
<li><strong>Interpolation:</strong> Using different interpolation techniques based on the number of points available:
<ul>
<li><strong>Linear Interpolation (2 points):</strong> For simple movements between two positions.</li>
<li><strong>Quadratic Interpolation (3 points):</strong> For smoother curves with three positions.</li>
<li><strong>Centripetal Catmull–Rom Spline (More than 3 points):</strong> For complex paths requiring smooth and continuous curves.
This method is particularly effective at preserving the shape of the original path, even with sparse data points.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This combination of position history and interpolation allowed for accurate and smooth cursor movement, regardless of
the event frequency or network latency.</p>
<h3>Handling Out-of-Order Events</h3>
<p>Despite the improvements, I still encountered occasional glitches in the animation. After investigation, I discovered
that some older events were arriving after newer ones due to network delays. To resolve this, I implemented a simple
timestamp check:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Timestamp Verification:</strong> Each event is timestamped on the client before being sent to the server and retained on
the server. The server and receiving clients discard any events with timestamps older than the latest received
timestamp for a particular player.</li>
</ul>
<p>This simple fix eliminated most of the remaining animation artifacts and significantly improved the smoothness of the
cursor movements.</p>
<h3>Fine-Tuning the Animation</h3>
<p>Finally, I added a subtle touch to further enhance the visual smoothness: micro-tweening. Instead of directly updating
the cursor position to the target position, I implemented a gradual approach:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Partial Updates:</strong> When the cursor is moving, the position is updated by 50% towards the target in each frame. When
the cursor stops moving (no new events received for a short period), the position is updated by 80% towards the
target.</li>
</ul>
<p>This technique creates a subtle "easing out" effect, reducing the perceived digital nature of the movement and providing
a more natural and responsive feel.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>Building a real-time multiplayer cursor system requires careful consideration of various factors, particularly network
latency and animation smoothness. By implementing event batching, intelligent interpolation, timestamp verification, and
micro-tweening, I was able to create a robust and performant solution that provides a seamless and accurate real-time
cursor sharing experience. This project highlighted the importance of understanding network behavior and employing
appropriate techniques to mitigate its impact on user experience.</p>

<p>Imagine waiting 5 minutes for a simple Excel report to generate. Frustrating, right? This was the reality I faced when working with a legacy system that was tasked with producing these reports. Determined to improve this sluggish process, I embarked on a journey of optimization that ultimately transformed the system's performance from a snail's pace to a cheetah's sprint.</p>
<h3>The Problem</h3>
<p>The legacy system, built using NodeJS and relying on external libraries to generate Excel files, was struggling to keep up with the demand. Even for relatively small reports, consisting of just 10 columns and 100 rows, the generation time was a staggering 5 minutes. This bottleneck was not only frustrating for users but also consuming excessive system resources.</p>
<h3>The Evaluation</h3>
<p>Initially, I explored the possibility of optimizing the system by switching to different libraries. Python libraries, known for their efficiency, were among the first options I considered. While they did offer some improvement, the generation time still hovered around 2 minutes, far from satisfactory.</p>
<p>It became evident that the libraries themselves were not the root of the problem. After a thorough investigation, I decided to take a more radical approach: reverse engineering the Excel files to understand their underlying structure. This seemed like a daunting task, but the potential benefits outweighed the risks.</p>
<h3>The Breakthrough</h3>
<p>By dissecting the Excel files, I gained valuable insights into their composition and formatting. This knowledge allowed me to develop a custom solution that bypassed the limitations of the existing libraries. One of the key breakthroughs was the implementation of streaming, which enabled the system to process and write data to the Excel file in smaller chunks, significantly reducing memory consumption.</p>
<h3>The Technology Shift</h3>
<p>While the custom solution provided a substantial performance boost, I was still eager to explore other possibilities. I experimented with Golang and Rust, two languages renowned for their speed and efficiency. Golang, with its simplicity and concurrency features, showed promising results, reducing the generation time to around 8 seconds. However, its type system, which I found less intuitive at the time, was a minor drawback.</p>
<p>Rust, on the other hand, offered a compelling combination of performance and type safety. Its strict type checking helped me avoid common pitfalls and write more reliable code. Despite the initial learning curve, I was impressed by the speed and efficiency it brought to the table.</p>
<h3>The Results</h3>
<p>Ultimately, I decided to leverage the power of shell scripting to create the final solution. By combining bash with NodeJS or Lua for specific tasks, I was able to build a highly efficient system that utilized C binaries for reading and manipulating files. This approach resulted in a dramatic reduction in generation time, bringing it down to a mere 2 seconds.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>The journey to optimize the Excel generation process was a valuable learning experience. It taught me the importance of understanding the underlying problem, exploring unconventional solutions, and leveraging the right tools for the job. By combining reverse engineering, streaming, and strategic technology choices, I was able to transform a sluggish system into a high-performance powerhouse.</p>

<p>When a user is inactive for a prolonged period, it's often necessary to automatically log them out for security reasons.
However, this can lead to a frustrating user experience if they're suddenly logged out without a clear explanation and
especially when multiple open tabs are involved. To
mitigate this, we can leverage the power of <code>localStorage</code> and <code>sessionStorage</code> to display a consistent message across
multiple tabs and sessions.</p>
<h3>Why localStorage and sessionStorage?</h3>
<p>When multiple tabs are open, we need to ensure seamless communication between them within the current browser session.
To achieve this, we'll utilize sessionStorage, a web storage mechanism that persists data only for the duration of a
single browser session. By employing sessionStorage, we can effectively manage and coordinate state across various tabs,
guaranteeing that messages related to expired activity periods are displayed appropriately and only within the current
session.</p>
<h4>localStorage</h4>
<ul>
<li>Persistent storage that remains across browser sessions.</li>
<li>Ideal for scenarios where data needs to be shared between multiple tabs or devices.</li>
<li>In our case, we'll use it to trigger the logout message on all open tabs.</li>
</ul>
<h4>sessionStorage</h4>
<ul>
<li>Temporary storage that's cleared when the browser tab or window is closed.</li>
<li>Perfect for storing the logout message within a specific session.</li>
<li>Once the user closes the browser or logs back in, the message is removed.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Implementation Strategy</h3>
<h5>1. Timeout Detection and localStorage Update</h5>
<ul>
<li>When the timeout threshold is reached, set a flag in <code>localStorage</code> to indicate the logout.</li>
<li>This flag acts as a trigger for all open tabs.</li>
</ul>
<h5>2. Session Storage Synchronization</h5>
<ul>
<li>On page load or refresh, check the <code>localStorage</code> flag.</li>
<li>If the flag is set, store a value in <code>sessionStorage</code> to display the logout message.</li>
<li>This ensures that the message is shown only within the current session.</li>
</ul>
<h5>3. Message Display</h5>
<ul>
<li>Use JavaScript to check the <code>sessionStorage</code> value and display the logout message if it exists.</li>
<li>The message can be shown as a modal, alert, or a persistent notification.</li>
</ul>
<h5>4. Clearing the Flags</h5>
<ul>
<li>Once the user logs back in or closes the browser, clear both the <code>localStorage</code> and <code>sessionStorage</code> flags to prevent
the message from appearing unnecessarily.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Key Considerations</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Security:</strong> Ensure that sensitive information isn't stored in <code>localStorage</code>.</li>
<li><strong>User Experience:</strong> Design the logout message to be informative and clear.</li>
<li><strong>Browser Compatibility:</strong> Test your implementation across different browsers to ensure consistent behavior.</li>
<li><strong>Edge Cases:</strong> Consider scenarios like multiple devices, browser refreshes, and network interruptions.</li>
</ul>
<p>By carefully combining <code>localStorage</code> and <code>sessionStorage</code>, we can provide a seamless and user-friendly experience, even
in the face of timeouts due to a certain period of inactivity.</p>

real-time multiplayer experiences presents unique challenges, especially when precise synchronization and\nsmooth animations are crucial. In this article, I'll delve into the development of a system for displaying live\ncursors (mouse pointers) of multiple players on a shared board. Having previously experimented with similar concepts in\nless demanding environments, I faced the task of building a robust and accurate solution for a real-world application.\nThis project, while concise, offered valuable insights into tackling latency, event management, and animation smoothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eThe Challenge: Real-time Cursor Synchronization\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy previous attempts at implementing real-time cursor sharing were primarily proof-of-concept projects with relaxed\nrequirements. This new project demanded a production-ready solution, requiring careful consideration of network latency,\nevent handling, and rendering. The core challenge was ensuring a smooth and accurate representation of each player's\ncursor movements across all clients, even under varying network conditions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eAddressing Latency\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNetwork latency is an inherent issue in real-time applications. If events (cursor position updates) are sent\ninfrequently, the resulting cursor movement appears jerky and discontinuous, especially with latencies exceeding 50ms.\nSimply updating the cursor position based on each received event is insufficient. In prior projects, I used basic\ntweening (linear interpolation) between event positions to smooth the motion. However, this approach has a critical\nflaw: if intermediate events are lost due to network issues, the cursor's path becomes inaccurate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo address this, I implemented a more robust event management system. This involved:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eEvent Matching and Prioritization:\u003c/strong\u003e Ensuring that the most up-to-date events are sent to and processed by the\nserver and subsequently broadcast to other clients. This minimized the impact of out-of-order or duplicate events.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBatching Events:\u003c/strong\u003e Grouping multiple cursor position updates into batches before sending them to the server. This\nreduces network overhead and improves efficiency, especially under high event frequency.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eReplaying Cursor Movements with Interpolation\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBatching events introduces a new challenge: how to accurately render the cursor's path on receiving clients. The\nsolution was to implement a replay mechanism that reconstructs the cursor's movement based on the received batch of\nevents. This involved:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePosition History:\u003c/strong\u003e Maintaining a history of cursor positions for each player.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eInterpolation:\u003c/strong\u003e Using different interpolation techniques based on the number of points available:\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eLinear Interpolation (2 points):\u003c/strong\u003e For simple movements between two positions.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eQuadratic Interpolation (3 points):\u003c/strong\u003e For smoother curves with three positions.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCentripetal Catmull–Rom Spline (More than 3 points):\u003c/strong\u003e For complex paths requiring smooth and continuous curves.\nThis method is particularly effective at preserving the shape of the original path, even with sparse data points.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis combination of position history and interpolation allowed for accurate and smooth cursor movement, regardless of\nthe event frequency or network latency.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eHandling Out-of-Order Events\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDespite the improvements, I still encountered occasional glitches in the animation. After investigation, I discovered\nthat some older events were arriving after newer ones due to network delays. To resolve this, I implemented a simple\ntimestamp check:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTimestamp Verification:\u003c/strong\u003e Each event is timestamped on the client before being sent to the server and retained on\nthe server.

Instead of directly updating\nthe cursor position to the target position, I implemented a gradual approach:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePartial Updates:\u003c/strong\u003e When the cursor is moving, the position is updated by 50% towards the target in each frame. When\nthe cursor stops moving (no new events received for a short period), the position is updated by 80% towards the\ntarget.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis technique creates a subtle \"easing out\" effect, reducing the perceived digital nature of the movement and providing\na more natural and responsive feel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eConclusion\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBuilding a real-time multiplayer cursor system requires careful consideration of various factors, particularly network\nlatency and animation smoothness.

Frustrating, right? This was the reality I faced when working with a legacy system that was tasked with producing these reports. Determined to improve this sluggish process, I embarked on a journey of optimization that ultimately transformed the system's performance from a snail's pace to a cheetah's sprint.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eThe Problem\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe legacy system, built using NodeJS and relying on external libraries to generate Excel files, was struggling to keep up with the demand. Even for relatively small reports, consisting of just 10 columns and 100 rows, the generation time was a staggering 5 minutes. This bottleneck was not only frustrating for users but also consuming excessive system resources.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eThe Evaluation\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInitially, I explored the possibility of optimizing the system by switching to different libraries. Python libraries, known for their efficiency, were among the first options I considered. While they did offer some improvement, the generation time still hovered around 2 minutes, far from satisfactory.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt became evident that the libraries themselves were not the root of the problem. After a thorough investigation, I decided to take a more radical approach: reverse engineering the Excel files to understand their underlying structure. This seemed like a daunting task, but the potential benefits outweighed the risks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eThe Breakthrough\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy dissecting the Excel files, I gained valuable insights into their composition and formatting. This knowledge allowed me to develop a custom solution that bypassed the limitations of the existing libraries. One of the key breakthroughs was the implementation of streaming, which enabled the system to process and write data to the Excel file in smaller chunks, significantly reducing memory consumption.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eThe Technology Shift\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile the custom solution provided a substantial performance boost, I was still eager to explore other possibilities. I experimented with Golang and Rust, two languages renowned for their speed and efficiency. Golang, with its simplicity and concurrency features, showed promising results, reducing the generation time to around 8 seconds. However, its type system, which I found less intuitive at the time, was a minor drawback.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRust, on the other hand, offered a compelling combination of performance and type safety. Its strict type checking helped me avoid common pitfalls and write more reliable code. Despite the initial learning curve, I was impressed by the speed and efficiency it brought to the table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eThe Results\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUltimately, I decided to leverage the power of shell scripting to create the final solution. By combining bash with NodeJS or Lua for specific tasks, I was able to build a highly efficient system that utilized C binaries for reading and manipulating files. This approach resulted in a dramatic reduction in generation time, bringing it down to a mere 2 seconds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"/blog/excel-file-writer-dark.png\" alt=\"Image: The Overall Process\"\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"/blog/excel-file-writer-light.png\" alt=\"Image: The Overall Process\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eConclusion\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe journey to optimize the Excel generation process was a valuable learning experience.
